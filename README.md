Subject: Chess AI Project Check-In: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Implementation

Hi Professor,

We wanted to check in on my Chess AI project progress. So far, we have implemented Minimax with alpha-beta pruning to evaluate possible moves. 
The pruning helps the AI skip over branches that won’t lead to better outcomes, which has made the search much faster. We have also added a depth 
limit to ensure the AI responds in a reasonable amount of time, adjusting the depth based on remaining time. We feel good about the core functionality, 
but we are open to suggestions for any tuning tips. We will continue testing with different board setups to make sure it’s working consistently.

Thanks for any feedback,
Castle-vania

Subject: Chess AI Project Check-In: Evaluation Function and Next Steps

Hi Professor,

Following up on my Chess AI check-in, we have implemented a basic evaluation function focused on material advantage, assigning values to different piece types. 
This helps the AI make decisions based on capturing valuable pieces and avoiding risky moves when possible. We are also penalizing the AI slightly when it’s in 
check to keep the king safe.

For the next steps, we would like to improve the evaluation function with additional features like positional control (e.g., center control) and maybe add dynamic 
depth adjustments for the endgame. Let me know if you think I should focus on any specific improvements.

Best,
Castle-vania
